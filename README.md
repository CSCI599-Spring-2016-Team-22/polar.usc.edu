#D3 Visualizations

####Main HTML Files
The home page is located in index.html. Currently, we have a D3 tab in the navigation bar that leads to a separate HTML page -- this HTML file is located in data/HTML/D3.html. 

We are not planning to use this format do in the future, as we are going to integrate a couple of these examples within the home page particularly under the 'Features' section. Nevertheless, linking to separate HTML pages for now will be a good start.

####Where To Place Files
Files such as json, txt, and csv files belong in the data directory. Javascript files belong in the js/D3 directory. HTML files (which we will be eliminating later) should be placed in data/HTML directory.

When adding a new HTML file to the page, navigate to data/HTML/D3.html. Scroll down to the D3 section and simply add another link.
