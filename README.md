#D3 Visualizations

##Getting familiar with the file organization
The home page is located in index.html. Currently, we have a D3 tab in the navigation bar that leads to a separate HTML page, which is located in data/HTML/D3.html. 

This is not what we are planning to do in the future, as we are going to integrate a couple of these examples within the main index home page, particularly under the 'Features' section. However, separating out the files by linking to separate HTML pages for now will be a good start as integrating these widgets within another page is more difficult.
