#D3 Visualizations

####Main HTML Files
The home page is located in index.html. Currently, we have a D3 tab in the navigation bar that leads to a separate HTML page -- this HTML file is located in data/HTML/D3.html. 

We are not planning to use this format in the future as we are going to integrate a couple of these examples within the home page, particularly under the 'Features' section. Nevertheless, linking to separate HTML pages for now will be a good start.

####Where To Place Files
Files such as json, txt, and csv files belong in the data directory. Javascript files belong in the js/D3 directory. HTML files (which we will be eliminating later) should be placed in data/HTML directory.

When adding a new HTML file to the page, navigate to data/HTML/D3.html. Scroll down to the D3 section and simply add another link.

####How To Start Finding Projects
We will be mainly looking at D3 so focus on the HW3 project submissions found in the Dropbox link that Dr. Mattmann provided us.

Every team has a different structure for their project.
