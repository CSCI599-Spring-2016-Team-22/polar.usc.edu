	<p> The D3 difference chart shows the difference between the frequencies of the occurrences of the Global Warming and Climate change in the parsed crawled data. 
	The green shaded area denotes that the frequency of Global warming was greater that that of climate change. The red shaded region shows other way round.
	The graph shows that the rate of growth for global warming is proportional to the rate of climate change.</p>
